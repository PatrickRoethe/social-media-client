README

Description
This project is a social media client application developed as part of a workflow course assignment. 
It demonstrates the implementation of various development workflows and comprehensive testing strategies to enhance the quality of the software package. 
The project includes configuration of ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and Cypress for effective code quality and testing.

Installation Instructions
1. Clone repo - git clone https://github.com/PatrickRoethe/social-media-client.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory - cd social-media-client
3. install dependencies - npm install

Usage
Running tests

-Jest unit tests:
 npm test
-Cypress end to end tests: 
npm run cypress

Linting and formatting:
To lint and format the code, you can use the following command:
npm run lint

Tools and Configuration
ESLint: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
Prettier: A code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
Babel: A JavaScript compiler that allows the use of the latest JavaScript features by transpiling them to a version compatible with older browsers.
Jest: A testing framework for JavaScript, primarily used for unit testing.
Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
ESLint and Prettier Configuration
The configuration files for ESLint and Prettier are set up to ensure that the code adheres to specific style guidelines and best practices.

Babel Configuration
Babel is configured to transpile modern JavaScript syntax into a backward-compatible version, allowing the application to run in older environments.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Linting Errors: If you encounter linting errors, ensure that your code follows the ESLint rules specified in the configuration. You can run npm run lint to check for issues.
Test Failures: If a test fails, review the test output for information on what went wrong. Tests may fail if the application does not behave as expected.
Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of quality assurance practices in software development. The tests and tools used ensure that the application maintains high standards of code quality and functionality.

Workarounds and Potential Bugs

ESLint Rules:

In the project, the decision was made to ignore "unused variables" in index.js and cypress.config.js. 
This was a deliberate choice to accommodate the specific needs of the project and avoid unnecessary linting errors. 
It reflects a need to adjust ESLint rules to fit the project's actual requirements. 
If this situation affects others in the team, it may be worth discussing with the project owner for potential adjustments to the linting rules.

Cypress and Missing HTML Elements:

An issue was encountered where an alert element triggered by JavaScript was not captured by Cypress because it was not an HTML element. 
This can be considered a minor bug, as it is generally expected that error messages should be displayed as HTML elements for better testability and user experience. 
Reporting this issue to the project owner could help improve the testability and usability of the application in production.
